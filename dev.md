# Objective:

- Use `main.py` as a reference for the task. Do not edit this file.
- Transition from the current sync method to a WebSocket streaming method to connect to the API. Refer to `streamingApi.rst` for guidance.
- Modify `positions_WS_grouped.py` to:
    - Establish a connection to the streaming API.
    - Synchronize current positions with Airtable (refer to `main.py` for field parsing and syncing details).
    - Implement event listeners for real-time position updates.
    - Optionally, add a periodic connection health check to handle missed updates (can be added later).

# Guidelines:

- Refer to 'dev.md' (this file) after each step.
- Remove irrelevant items.
- Mark completed tasks as done.
- Add new items as they arise during the process.
  
DO NOT edit above this


# Current To-Do List
- [x] Establish a connection to the streaming API.
- [x] Synchronize current positions with Airtable.
- [x] Implement event listeners for real-time position updates.
- [x] Add a periodic connection health check to handle missed updates.

# Notes
- Implemented periodic connection health check in `positions_WS_grouped.py` to ensure the connection remains active and to handle reconnection if necessary.
